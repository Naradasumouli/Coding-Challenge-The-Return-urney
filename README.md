Coding Challenge The Return Journey
1. Create a Node.js server that connects to a MongoDB database.
2. Implement a user registration system that validates the user's IP address.
3. Send an OTP to the user's phone number.
4. Validate the OTP entered by the user against the OTP sent to their phone number.
5. Register the user in the database only if the OTP entered is valid.

Evaluation Criteria:
This Challenge is used to identify the expertise level of the candidate from Beginner to Hard. Do
not give up as you would be evaluated step-wise. We would recommend you complete the task
if possible! This will help you stand out from the crowd.
Steps to be executed in the below-mentioned order:
1. To connect to a MongoDB database, you can use the mongodb module. This module
provides functions for connecting to a MongoDB database, performing queries, and
retrieving results.
2. To validate the user's IP address, you can use the ipinfo module. This module provides
functions for retrieving information about an IP address, such as its country code and
city.
3. To send an OTP to the user's phone number, you can use the twilio module. This module
provides functions for sending and receiving SMS messages.(CREATE YOUR OWN twilio
account and setup the Api for sending messages)
4. To validate the OTP entered by the user, you can use the bcrypt module. This module
provides functions for hashing and comparing passwords.

5. To register the user in the database, you can use the mongoose module. This module
provides functions for modeling and querying MongoDB documents.

Code Regulations:
1. Error handling is mandatory.
2. Include necessary field Validations on NodeJS server side while sending request.
3. Usage of Effective names for Classes/Functions/Variables/Methods/Hooks will be
appreciated.
4. Comment code wherever necessary.
5. Follow clean directory & code structure# Coding-Challenge-The-Return-urney
